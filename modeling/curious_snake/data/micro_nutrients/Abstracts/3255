Background, Patients with cancer who are treated with chemotherapy or receive a bone marrow transplant have an increased risk of acquiring fungal infections. Such infections can be life-threatening. Antifungal drugs are therefore often given prophylactically to such patients, or when they have a fever., Objectives, To compare the benefits and harms of lipid soluble formulations of amphotericin B with conventional amphotericin B in cancer patients with neutropenia., Search strategy, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE (July 2004). Unpublished trials from conference proceedings and contact to industry., Selection criteria, Randomised trials comparing lipid soluble formulations of amphotericin B with conventional amphotericin B., Data collection and analysis, Data on mortality, invasive fungal infection, nephrotoxicity, serum creatinine and dropouts were extracted by both authors independently., Main results, We found 12 trials (1895 patients). Lipid-based amphotericin B was not more effective than conventional amphotericin B for mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.12), but decreased invasive fungal infection (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97), nephrotoxicity, defined as a 100% increase in serum creatinine (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.54), and number of dropouts (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97)., For the drug used in most patients, AmBisome (3 trials, 1149 patients), there was no significant difference in mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.07) whereas it tended to be more effective than conventional amphotericin B for invasive fungal infection (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.01, P = 0.053)., AmBisome, amphotericin B in Intralipid (6 trials, 379 patients), amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCD) (2 trials, 262 patients), and amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) (1 trial, 105 patients) all decreased the occurrence of nephrotoxicity, but conventional amphotericin B was rarely administered under optimal circumstances., Authors' conclusions, It is not clear whether there are any advantages of lipid-based formulations if conventional amphotericin B is administered under optimal circumstances and their high cost prohibits routine use in most settings. There is a need for large trials comparing lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B with conventional amphotericin B given in the same dose, with routine premedication for prevention of infusion-related toxicity, and with supplementation with fluid, potassium and magnesium for prevention of nephrotoxicity
