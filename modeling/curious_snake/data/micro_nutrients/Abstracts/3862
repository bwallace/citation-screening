PURPOSE: Anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with central venous catheters is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with central venous catheters. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to May 2006, supplemented by manual searches of conference proceedings and bibliographies. RESULTS: Fifteen trials were included. Unfractionated heparin infusion, oral fixed low-dose vitamin K antagonist, and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin were evaluated. For all catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis (symptomatic and asymptomatic combined), the summary relative risks ranged from 0.31 to 0.73 (all achieved statistical significance). For symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, the summary relative risks ranged from 0.28 to 0.72, but did not achieve statistical significance for any individual regimen. CONCLUSION: Anticoagulant prophylaxis is effective for preventing all catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis in patients with central venous catheters. The effectiveness for preventing symptomatic venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism, remains uncertain. [References: 98]
