OBJECTIVE: Internal and external bleaching procedures utilizing 3-35% hydrogen peroxide solutions or hydrogen peroxide releasing agents, such as carbamide peroxide or sodium perborate, can be used for whitening of teeth. The purpose of the review article was to summarize and discuss the available information concerning the effects of peroxide releasing bleaching agents on dental restorative materials and restorations. SOURCES: Information from all original scientific full papers or reviews listed in PubMed or ISI Web of Science (search term: bleaching AND (composite OR amalgam OR glass ionomer OR compomer OR resin OR alloy) were included in the review. DATA: Existing literature reveals that bleaching therapies may have a negative effect on physical properties, marginal integrity, enamel and dentin bond strength, and color of restorative materials as investigated in numerous in vitro studies. However, there are no reports in literature indicating that bleaching may exert a negative impact on existing restorations requiring renewal of the restorations under clinical conditions. CONCLUSION: Bleaching may exert a negative influence on restorations and restorative materials. Advice is provided based on the current literature to minimize the impact of bleaching therapies on restorative materials and restorations. [References: 113]
