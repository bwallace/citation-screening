Background, Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV infection is one of the most tragic consequences of the HIV epidemic, especially in resource-limited countries, resulting in about 650 000 new paediatric HIV infections each year worldwide. The paediatric HIV epidemic threatens to seriously undermine decade-old child survival programmes., Objectives, To estimate the effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV and infant and maternal mortality and morbidity, as well as tolerability of vaginal disinfection in HIV-infected women., Search strategy, We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Register, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, LILACS, AIDSTRIALS, and AIDSDRUGS, using standardised methodological filters for identifying trials. We also searched reference lists of identified articles, relevant editorials, expert opinions and letters to journal editors, and abstracts and proceedings of relevant conferences, and contacted subject experts and pharmaceutical companies. There were no language restrictions., Selection criteria, Randomised trials or clinical trials comparing vaginal disinfection during labour with placebo or no treatment, in known HIV-infected pregnant women. Trials had to include an estimate of the effect of vaginal disinfection on MTCT of HIV and or infant and maternal mortality and morbidity., Data collection and analysis, Three authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Meta-analysis was performed using the Yusuf-Peto modification of Mantel-Haenszel's fixed effect method., Main results, Only two trials that included 708 patients met the inclusion criteria. The effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.33), neonatal death (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.30 to 6.33), and death after the neonatal period (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.47 to 4.45) is uncertain. There was no evidence that vaginal disinfection increased adverse effects in mothers (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.22), and evidence from one trial showed that adverse effects decreased in neonates (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.31)., Authors' conclusions, Currently, there is no evidence of an effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV. Given its simplicity and low cost, there is need for a large well-designed and well-conducted randomised controlled trial to assess the additive effect of vaginal disinfection on the risk of MTCT of HIV in antiretroviral treated women
