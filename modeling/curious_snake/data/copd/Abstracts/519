Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most relevant pathogen producing chronic lung infections in patients with chronic underlying diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hypermutable (or mutator) P. aeruginosa strains, characterized by increased (up to 1,000-fold) spontaneous mutation rates due to alterations of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system have been found at high frequencies in the lungs of CF patients, but their role in other chronic processes is still unknown. Sixty-two P. aeruginosa isolates from 30 patients with underlying non-CF chronic respiratory diseases (22 with bronchiectasis and 8 with COPD) and documented chronic infection were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles and mutation frequencies were determined, and complementation assays using the cloned wild-type mutS gene and molecular epidemiology studies (pulsed-field electrophoresis, [PFGE]) were performed with these strains. Thirty-three (53%) of the isolates were hypermutable, and 17 (57%) of the 30 patients were colonized by hypermutable strains. Strains from 11 of the 17 patients were found to be defective in the MMR mutS gene by complementation assays. Interpatient transmission of strains was ruled out by PFGE. Multiple-antimicrobial resistance was documented in 42% of the hypermutable strains in contrast to 0% resistance in the nonhypermutable strains (P < 0.0001). Hypermutable P. aeruginosa strains are extremely prevalent in chronic infections in contrast to what has been described in acute processes, suggesting a role of hypermutation in bacterial adaptation for long-term persistence. Furthermore, hypermutation is found to be a key factor for the development of multiple-antimicrobial resistance, and therefore these findings are expected to have important consequences for the treatment of chronic infections
