Malignant salivary gland tumors are relatively rare and account for only 3%-4% of all head and neck cancers. Especially in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the incidence of local recurrence and distant metastases is influenced by the perineural spread of tumor. In advanced salivary gland tumors, surgery alone has a high incidence of local failure. The results of conventional radiotherapy are suboptimal in inoperable or not completely resected salivary gland tumors and in recurrent disease. The pooled data of some international series for low linear energy transfer radiation show a local control of only 28%. Especially in advanced salivary gland tumors, neutron therapy can improve local control. In Europe at least 570 patients with salivary gland tumors have been treated with neutrons alone or with combined modalities. The clinical data of different centers in Europe and the United States result in a similar local control rate of 67% in gross disease. An analysis of different European series shows on average a complication rate of 10.6% for severe radiation-related morbidity. Modern neutron machines and the use of three-dimensional treatment planning systems are now available in a few institutions and may further reduce side effects. [References: 58]
