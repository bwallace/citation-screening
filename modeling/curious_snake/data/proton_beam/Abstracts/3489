We report on CT and MR image findings of a skull base chondrosarcoma. Chondroid mineralisation, a histological feature of chondrosarcoma, can be recognised on CT and is, together with the off-midline position of the tumour, the most characteristic finding. Differentiation is usually made by histological and immunocytochemical staining. Surgery, proton radiation therapy and stereotactic single high-dose irradiation have been used to treat patients with chondrosarcoma. It is worth mentioning that it was likely that the chondrosarcoma in our patient represented a malignant degeneration of an enchondroma that had been resected 30 years earlier
