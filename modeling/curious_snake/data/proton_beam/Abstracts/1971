A simple algorithm was developed for calculation of the in-air output at various source-to-detector distances (SDDs) on the central axis for wedged fields. In the algorithm we dealt independently with two effective sources, one for head scatter and the other for wedge scatter. Varian 2100C with 18 and 8 MV photon beams was used to examine this algorithm. The effective source position for head scatter for wedged fields was assumed to be the same as that for open fields, and the effective source position for wedge scatter was assumed to be a certain distance upstream from the physical location of the wedge. The shift of the effective source for wedge scatter, w, was found to be independent of field size. Moreover, we observed no systematic dependency of w on wedge angle or beam energy. One value, w = 5.5 cm, provided less than 1% difference in in-air outputs through the whole experimental range, i.e., 6 x 6 to 20 x 20 cm2 field size (15 x 20 cm2 for 60 degrees wedge), 15 degrees-60 degrees wedge angle, 80-130 cm SDD, and both 18 and 8 MV photon beams. This algorithm can handle the case in which use of a tertiary collimator with an external wedge makes the field size for the determination of wedge scatter different from that for head scatter. In this case, without the two-effective-source method, the maximum of 4.7% and 2.6% difference can be given by the inverse square method and one-effective-source method in a 45 degrees wedged field with 18 MV. Differences can be larger for thicker wedges. Enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) fields were also examined. It was found that no second effective source is required for EDW fields
