We have developed a simple collimator model to improve the accuracy of penumbra behaviour in pencil-beam dose calculation for proton radiotherapy. In this model, transmission of particles through a three-dimensionally extended opening of a collimator is calculated in conjunction with phase-space distribution of the particles. Comparison of the dose distributions calculated using the new three-dimensional collimator model and the conventional two-dimensional model to lateral dose profiles experimentally measured with collimated proton beams showed the superiority of the new model over the conventional one
