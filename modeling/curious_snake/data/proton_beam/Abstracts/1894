A semi-automatic technique for the direct setup alignment of radiosurgical circular fields from an isocentric linac to treatment room laser cross-hairs is described. Alignment is achieved by acquiring images of the treatment room positioning laser cross-hairs superimposed on the radiosurgical circular field image. An alignment algorithm calculates the center of the radiosurgical field image as well as the intersection of the laser cross-hairs. This determines any alignment deviations and the information is then used to translate the radiosurgical collimator to its correct aligned position. Two detectors, each being sensitive to the lasers and ionizing radiation, were used to acquire the radiation/laser images. The first detector consists of a 0.3-mm-thick layer of photoconducting a-Se deposited on a 1.5-mm-thick copper plate and the second is film. The algorithm and detector system can detect deviations with a precision of approximately 0.04 mm. A device with gyroscopic degrees of freedom was built in order to firmly hold the detector at any orientation perpendicular to the radiosurgical beam axis. This device was used in conjunction with our alignment algorithm to quantify the isocentric sphere relative to the treatment room lasers over all gantry and couch angles used in dynamic stereotactic radiosurgery
