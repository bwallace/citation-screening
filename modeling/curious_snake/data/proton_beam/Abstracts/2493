The neutron capture reaction 10B(1n,4He)7Li produces two energetic particles, 4He2+ and 7Li3+ that are strongly cell toxic. Due to the short range of these nuclear fragments (5-9 microns) mainly those cells that have bound or internalized a 10B-containing substance are growth-inactivated. The most critical and difficult step in an efficient boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is the tumour targeting. It is today possible to synthesize a large number of boron compounds and conjugate them to tumour-seeking macromolecules, such as monoclonal antibodies or different polypeptides. The boron-containing substances presently considered for therapy are sulfhydryl boron hydride (BSH) and boron-phenylalanine, (BPA) for the treatment of gliomas and malignant melanomas respectively. Other boronated compounds considered are ligands for receptor-amplified tumour cells, antibodies for tumour cells with specific antigens and thioureas for treatment of melanotic melanomas. The required boron concentration is given by the relative dose due to neutron capture in 10B and that of the competing capture reactions in nitrogen and hydrogen. Capture in nitrogen produces protons with a range of about 10-11 microns and this gives a radiation dose to all cells in the neutron activated area. Calculations show that the local concentration of 10B near the critical radiation target, DNA, must be higher than 10 ppm (10 micrograms/g). Increased emphasis will be put on the development of combinations of treatments that fulfil the requirements for attacking the microscopic spread of the tumour. [References: 97]
