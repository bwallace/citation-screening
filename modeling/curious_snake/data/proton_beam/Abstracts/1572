Inverse planning for intensity- and energy-modulated radiotherapy (IEMRT) with proton beams involves the selection of (i) the relative importance factors to control the relative importance of the target and sensitive structures, (ii) an appropriate energy resolution to achieve an acceptable depth modulation, (iii) an appropriate beamlet width to modulate the beam laterally, and (iv) a sufficient number of beams and their orientations. In this article we investigate the influence of these variables on the optimized dose distribution of a simulated prostate cancer IEMRT treatment. Good dose conformation for this prostate case was achieved using a constellation of I factors for the target, rectum, bladder, and normal tissues of 500, 50, 15, and 1, respectively. It was found that for an active beam delivery system, the energy resolution should be selected on the basis of the incident beams' energy spread (sigmaE) and the appropriate energy resolution varied from 1 MeV at sigmaE = 0.0 to 5 MeV at sigmaE= 2.0 MeV. For a passive beam delivery system the value of the appropriate depth resolution for inverse planning may not be critical as long as the value chosen is at least equal to one-half the FWHM of the primary beam Bragg peak. Results indicate that the dose grid element dimension should be equal to or no less than 70% of the beamlet width. For this prostate case, we found that a maximum of three to four beam ports is required since there was no significant advantage to using a larger number of beams. However for a small number (< or = 4) of beams the selection of beam orientations, while having only a minor effect on target coverage, strongly influenced the sensitive structure sparing and normal tissue integral dose
