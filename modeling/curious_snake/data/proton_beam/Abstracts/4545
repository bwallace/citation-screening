A medico-biological complex for fast neutron therapy of cancer and research in physics and radiobiology was developed at the Siberian Branch of the Center within the framework of Cyclotron Department of Research Institute of Nuclear Physics (Polytechnical Institute, Tomsk). Certain problems of forming a fast neutron beam from the Y-120 type cyclotron are discussed. Baseline data of dosimetric and radiobiologic studies are presented. The first experience of Soviet researchers with fast neutron treatment of head and neck cancer is described. Favorable preliminary results suggest further clinical application of the said procedure
