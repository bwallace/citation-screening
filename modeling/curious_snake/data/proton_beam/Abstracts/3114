Vascular complications occurring late after exposure to thorium dioxide (thorotrast) are described in two patients. One patient had both cerebral andmyocardial infarcts and died at age 25 years. Necropsy disclosed both adventitial and intimal fibrosis of the left carotid artery and greater than 75 per cent cross-sectional area luminal narrowing of both the left main and left anterior descending coronary arteries. The other patient, a 33 year old man, had no cerebral symptoms in life but total obstruction of the right carotid artery secondary to a thorotrastoma was found at necropsy. Vascular complications due to thorotrast appear to represent consequences of chronic alpha irradiation
