Our objective was to assess proton chemical shift imaging for potential clinical application in monitoring response to gamma knife radiosurgery. Twenty-five proton chemical shift imaging studies and conventional magnetic resonance images were performed on six patients with intracranial tumors. The peak areas of N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine, and lipids were calculated and normalized to N-acetylaspartate in the contralateral hemisphere. The spectra from the lesion before treatment showed a relatively high Cho peak, reported as a characteristic spectrum of tumors. Tumor size and Cho level after radiosurgery did not increase except in two cases. In these cases, radiation necrosis was observed with elevated Cho and a mobile lipid peak. Stable or decreased Cho seems to suggest a loss of tumor viability, and changes in Cho indicate the effectiveness of radiosurgery. Increasing Cho and the appearance of the mobile lipid peak may distinguish radiation necrosis from recurrent tumors, which cannot be distinguished by magnetic resonance imaging
