The first Mitsubishi medical linear accelerator in the United States was commissioned in April 1985. This unit EXL-8 (marketed by Mitsubishi International Corporation) produces 8-MeV electron beams in addition to 6-MV x rays. It is a 100-cm source-axis distance isocentric machine. Acceptance testing and performance evaluation of this accelerator were completed. Our measurements included beam characteristics and dosimetry parameters for both modalities. Central axis % depth dose (% DD), tissue-maximum ratio, field size output factors, wedge factors, etc., for this Linac 6-MV beam, are reported. Characteristics of the 8-MeV electron beam, namely % DD data, isodose curves, and cone ratios for various electron applicators are presented
